    Figure \ref{fig:line graph amorphous} provides a concise overview of how the dopant and substrate mixture change with omega. 
    All three methods show the amorphous percent decreases with depth, which is to be expected. 
    They also show that the 0.005 omega is greater than 1 for the amorphous.
    This is due to the crystalline peak being nonexistent, but the program is still trying to see a peak.
    The curve fitting and summation method provide excellent agreement with each other, while the ratio method alludes to an exponential.

    Figure \ref{fig:depth vs omega} shows the depth that correlates with the three methods. 
    The methods have a close agreement, with the curve fit and summation method being right on top of each other.
    They all show a mostly linear relationship, which is to be expected since the indices of refraction are very similar for the dopant and substrate.
    Nevertheless, it is interesting that the methods more closely agree at lower and high omegas, but not the middle omegas.
